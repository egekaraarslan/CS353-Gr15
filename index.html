      <p>Online Real Estate System is an application that provides services for renting, selling and buying real estates. The system stores the desired information and details about the real estate properties in a database system. It also stores information about the people involved in the process of buying, renting and selling of real estates. The information about the real estates that will be available are the necessary features that are considered in this process such as address, price, size etc. Further information about the neighborhood of the estate will be stored as well so that the users can be informed on information such as the crime rate and number of schools in the area that are essential for choosing a place to live. The users can also reach further and more detailed information about the neighborhood from the discussion forums that are available in which users can ask questions, give answers, make comments and rate the response. The users can also follow neighborhoods to be informed when a new property is available in that area. The information of the users will also be stored such as their name, contact information, their roles in the system. The users can be agents that will be the middleman in this process, the owners that want to sell or rent their property and the customers that want a property. The agents will receive requests from the owners so that they can start the transaction process. The owners will provide the detailed information about the properties. The agents and the owners will have a rating based on the past property that they dealt with given by the customers that interacted with them. There will be also technical information regarding the agents such as their company and commision rates. All of the users will be able to search real estate properties and find the necessary information about them.
